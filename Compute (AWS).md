* PROBLEMS : 
   * Adding Targets requires you to give instance idâ€™s. In AWS we have tags
   * API To start instance was not found
   * If we use Event Bridge we have access to all APIs but we need some role to do the job. We need to configure the role
* SOLUTION : 
   * Fetching instance ids
   * Configuring Role
   * CLI option:
      * Need to work with aws cli i.e. configure IAM user
      * need to understand json
      * Searching aws cli options
   * Lambda:
      * Knowing a programming language
      * Configure IAM Role

### Updating OS in EC2 instance

* I have an ec2 instance with ubuntu 20.04, in this i need to install an os update (Patching)
* Possible Solutions: Try to figure out

### Securing Access

* You are an aws administrator and your organization has two projects and keys are maintained at project
* You were asked to do some activity on linux machine (ec2 instance)
* How can you login without ssh key

### Lost PEM file

* Some of your team member has lost pem file and we need to recover the server

![Alt text](Shots/129.PNG)

=> Give a name => Next

![Alt text](Shots/130.PNG)

=> Attach policies directly => select `AdmintratorAccess` policy => Next

![Alt text](Shots/131.PNG)

=> Create user

![Alt text](Shots/136.PNG)

=> Attach tags => Create access key => Down load the keys

![Alt text](Shots/137.PNG)
![Alt text](Shots/138.PNG)

=> Do `aws configure` on the commandline

![Alt text](Shots/139.PNG)

* General commands with prefixes :
   * to view `describe*` `list*`
   * to create `create*` `run*`
   * to delete `delete*` `terminate*`
   * to modify `modify*` `update*`

### Exercise

* Try doing the same to install php info page with ubuntu 20 ami
* delete the ec2 instance
* The below script is to create an ec2 instance and also to terminate the instance after the use of this instance
```
#!/bin/bash

# get the ami id
ami_id=$(aws ec2 describe-images --filters "Name=name,Values=ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-*" --query "Images[0].ImageId" --output text)


# get default vpc id
vpc_id=$(aws ec2 describe-vpcs --filters "Name=is-default,Values=true" --query "Vpcs[0].VpcId" --output text)

# create security group with 22,80 ports opened
sg_id=$(aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name sshnhttpsg --description "open 22 and 80" --vpc-id $vpc_id --output text --query "GroupId")

# open 22,80 ports to all
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id $sg_id \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 22 \
    --cidr '0.0.0.0/0'

aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
    --group-id $sg_id \
    --protocol tcp \
    --port 80 \
    --cidr '0.0.0.0/0'

# get the instance id
aws ec2 run-instances \
    --image-id $ami_id \
    --instance-type "t2.micro" \
    --key-name "my_id_rsa" \
    --security-group-ids $sg_id \
    --associate-public-ip-address

# using instance id fetch public ip
public_ip=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=instance-state-name,Values=running" --query "Reservations[0].Instances[0].PublicIpAddress" --output text) 
echo "http://${public_ip}"
```
* Login to the machine using the IP address generated from the  above script and expose the page over the browser `http://<public_ip>`

* Queries for :
   1. AMI id
   2. security group (22 & 80)
   3. key pair : my_id_rsa
   4. instance size : t2.micro

   * ami_filter_name name
   * ami_filetr_value ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-jammy-22.04-amd64-server-20230208
   * aws_keypair_name
   * instance_type
   * security_group_id

## Compute - Workshop (18/Mar/2023)

* Areas of Focus
   * Automation
   * Administration

#### Activity-1 : Shutdown all instances which have tag `QA`

* Setup : Create 3 ec2 instances of `free tier` and provide `tags`
   * Machine 1 => QA => Env: QA
   * Machine 2 => Dev => Env: Dev
   * Machine 3 => UAT => Env: UAT

![Alt text](Shots/144.PNG)

* To differ the instances using tags and output as text and to get more than one environment (refer from aws cli cheat sheet for options)
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --filter "Name=tag:Env,Values=QA/Dev/UAT" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId"
```
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --filter "Name=tag:Env,Values=QA/Dev/UAT" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId" --output text
```
```
aws ec2 describe-instances --filter "Name=tag:Env,Values=QA,Dev,UAT" --query "Reservations[].Instances[].InstanceId" --output text
```

_**NOTE : We need to apply it in a new repository created to work accordingly**_

* For the _**CLI**_ with script `activity .sh`

   [ Refer here : https://github.com/asquarezone/awsadministration/commit/50d0ac97a2a90e7958fad3ea05e93a95719e902d ]

* Improvement-1 : This script was failing if there are no instances having matching critiera, so we add a _**flag or condition**_ `activity1.sh`
   * For changes

   [ Refer here : https://github.com/asquarezone/awsadministration/commit/2ad90adae3da28e2e35942be55c79fc34c0f2788 ]

* Improvement-2 : Make this script work for tag `Env=Dev` 
   * For the imporvement where user can now call `activity2.sh` `<tag-name> <tag-value>`

   [ Refer here : https://github.com/asquarezone/awsadministration/commit/634b76edfa274b698cec6905f22c3d0a26adbf20 ]

#### Activity-2 : Resize the EC2 instance from `t2.micro` to `t2.nano` based on _**tags**_ `activity3.sh`

![Alt text](Shots/147.PNG)
![Alt text](Shots/148.PNG)
